<p><!-- wp:jetpack/markdown {"source":"The kube-scheduler is responsible for scheduling Pods on Nodes, i.e. it would assign Pods to available Nodes, however it is not responsible for running the Pods, which is kubelet's job. A cluster needs to have atleast one scheduler, and its also possible to run multiple schedulers based on the need\n\nWe have a k8s cluster launched using kubeadm, and it has one scheduler as follows, in the kube-system namespace\n```\nnetworkandcode@k8s-master-0:~$ kubectl get po -n kube-system | grep scheduler\nkube-scheduler-k8s-master-0                1\/1     Running   3          3d23h\n```\n\nLet's check the container image in the scheduler Pod\n```\nnetworkandcode@k8s-master-0:~$ kubectl get po kube-scheduler-k8s-master-0 -n kube-system -o jsonpath={.spec.containers[].image}\nk8s.gcr.io\/kube-scheduler:v1.16.4\n```\n\nkube-scheduler is the default scheduler used in Kubernetes, however we could also write custom kubernetes schedulers with custom names.\n\nLet's check one of the Pods' spec and see the schedulerName defined in it, for instance we can check the kube-apiserver which is in the kube-system namespace\n```\nnetworkandcode@k8s-master-0:~$ kubectl get po kube-apiserver-k8s-master-0 -n kube-system -o jsonpath={.spec.schedulerName}\ndefault-scheduler\n```\nThe Pod's ```spec.schedulerName``` has the value ```default-scheduler``` which refers to the default kube-scheduler Pod we saw earlier\n\nLet's now launch a second scheduler in our cluster, however we could use the usual kube-scheduler image, but give it a custom name. For this purpose we can leverage the configuration of the default scheduler Pod which is usually stored in ```\/etc\/kubernetes\/manifests\/kube-scheduler.yaml``` of the master\n```\nnetworkandcode@k8s-master-0:~$ ls \/etc\/kubernetes\/manifests\/\netcd.yaml  kube-apiserver.yaml  kube-controller-manager.yaml  kube-scheduler.yaml\n```\n\nWe can create a new configuration file for the second scheduler in the same folder by copying contents from the existing file ``kube-scheduler.yaml`` and doing few modifications to it\n```\nnetworkandcode@k8s-master-0:~$ cd \/etc\/kubernetes\/manifests\nnetworkandcode@k8s-master-0:~$\nnetworkandcode@k8s-master-0:~$ sudo cp kube-scheduler.yaml kube-extra-scheduler.yaml\n```\n\nBefore modifying the new file, let's see the logs of the existing scheduler\n```\nnetworkandcode@k8s-master:~$ kubectl logs kube-scheduler-k8s-master-0 -n kube-system\nI1223 07:26:42.928378       1 serving.go:319] Generated self-signed cert in-memory\nI1223 07:26:43.546765       1 server.go:148] Version: v1.16.4\nI1223 07:26:43.547054       1 defaults.go:91] TaintNodesByCondition is enabled, PodToleratesNodeTaints predicate is mandatory\nW1223 07:26:43.560915       1 authorization.go:47] Authorization is disabled\nW1223 07:26:43.561176       1 authentication.go:79] Authentication is disabled\nI1223 07:26:43.561271       1 deprecated_insecure_serving.go:51] Serving healthz insecurely on [::]:10251\nI1223 07:26:43.564017       1 secure_serving.go:123] Serving securely on 127.0.0.1:10259\nI1223 07:26:43.671382       1 leaderelection.go:241] attempting to acquire leader lease  kube-system\/kube-scheduler...\nI1223 07:27:00.264646       1 leaderelection.go:251] successfully acquired lease kube-system\/kube-scheduler\n```\nThe logs show that the default insecure port is 10251 and the default secure port is 10259, as these values are not explicitly mentioned in the manifest ```kube-scheduler.yaml```. Note that the insecure port is deprecated and we could however use it on the new scheduler to avoid port conflicts\n\nThese ports should be active on the master\n```\nkubeTrain@k8s-master-0:~$ telnet localhost 10251\nTrying 127.0.0.1...\nConnected to localhost.\nEscape character is '^]'.\n^C\nConnection closed by foreign host.\nkubeTrain@k8s-master-0:~$ telnet localhost 10259\nTrying 127.0.0.1...\nConnected to localhost.\nEscape character is '^]'.\n```\n\nWe need two such ports for the new scheduler to avoid port conflict, let's see if 10255 and 10260 are not used in the cluster, so that we can it use for the new scheduler\n```\nkubeTrain@k8s-master-0:~$ telnet localhost 10255\nTrying 127.0.0.1...\ntelnet: Unable to connect to remote host: Connection refused\n\nkubeTrain@k8s-master-0:~$ telnet localhost 10260\nTrying 127.0.0.1...\ntelnet: Unable to connect to remote host: Connection refused\n```\nAs the telnet connection is refused, we could use these ports\n\nLet's now modify the new file, so that it would look like\n```\nnetworkandcode@k8s-master-0:~$ sudo cat kube-extra-scheduler.yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  \u002d\u002dTRUNCATED\u002d\u002d\n  labels:\n    component: kube-extra-scheduler\n    tier: control-plane\n  name: kube-extra-scheduler\n  \u002d\u002dTRUNCATED\u002d\u002d\nspec:\ncontainers:\n  - command:\n    - kube-scheduler\n    - \u002d\u002dauthentication-kubeconfig=\/etc\/kubernetes\/scheduler.conf\n    - \u002d\u002dauthorization-kubeconfig=\/etc\/kubernetes\/scheduler.conf\n    - \u002d\u002dbind-address=127.0.0.1\n    - \u002d\u002dkubeconfig=\/etc\/kubernetes\/scheduler.conf\n    - \u002d\u002dleader-elect=false\n    - \u002d\u002dscheduler-name=kube-extra-scheduler\n    - \u002d\u002dport=10255\n    - \u002d\u002dsecure-port=10260\n  \u002d\u002dTRUNCATED\u002d\u002d\n    livenessProbe:\n      \u002d\u002dTRUNCATED\u002d\u002d\n      httpGet:\n        host: 127.0.0.1\n        path: \/healthz\n        port: 10260\n        scheme: HTTP\n    \u002d\u002dTRUNCATED\u002d\u002d\n    name: kube-extra-scheduler\n  \u002d\u002dTRUNCATED\u002d\u002d\n```\n\nIn the manifest above we have used the insecure port 10255, secure port as 10260, and the health check was pointed to the secure port 10260. We have disabled the leader election, which would be required when we have multiple schedulers in High Availabilty mode. And we have given the new scheduler, a name 'kube-extra-scheduler'.

<p>This is because the Pod needs the scheduler to only schedule it and not for executing it</p>
<pre><code>networkandcode@k8s-master:~$ kubectl describe po po37 | tail -5
  Normal  Scheduled  &lt;unknown&gt;  kube-extra-scheduler  Successfully assigned default/po37 to k8s-node-2
  Normal  Pulling    12m        kubelet, k8s-node-2   Pulling image &quot;httpd&quot;
  Normal  Pulled     12m        kubelet, k8s-node-2   Successfully pulled image &quot;httpd&quot;
  Normal  Created    12m        kubelet, k8s-node-2   Created container ctr37
  Normal  Started    12m        kubelet, k8s-node-2   Started container ctr37
</code></pre>
<p>Let's delete the Pod, and try creating it again</p>
<pre><code>networkandcode@k8s-master:~$ kubectl delete po po37
pod &quot;po37&quot; deleted

networkandcode@k8s-master:~$ kubectl create -f ex37-po-extra-scheduler.yaml
pod/po37 created
</code></pre>
<p>The Pod would be in Pending state as it couldnt be scheduled by a scheduler which is not present. And the Pod won't show any events as it doesn't get any from the Scheduler</p>
<pre><code>networkandcode@k8s-master:~$ kubectl get po po37
NAME   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
po37   0/1     Pending   0          2m13s
networkandcode@k8s-master:~$ kubectl describe po po37 | grep Events
Events:          &lt;none&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Let's do the cleanup by deleting the Pod</p>
<pre><code>networkandcode@k8s-master:~$ kubectl delete po po37
pod &quot;po37&quot; deleted
</code></pre>
