<p>ConfigMaps are dictionaries or maps holding a set of key value pairs. ConfigMaps are also Kubernetes objects. For example if there is a Pod and there are lots of configuration in it, we can keep the Pod configuration/manifest simple by keeping all the configuration related information separately as a ConfigMap, and we would then relate the Pod with the ConfigMap so that the Pod takes it's configuration from the ConfigMap.</p>

<p>ConfigMaps can also be thought of like 'Secrets' which are again Kubernetes objects holding key value pairs, however the difference is that Secrets contain encrypted data and are more secure, where as ConfigMaps contain unencrypted data and are often used to store data that is no sensitive</p>
